Yo! I'm a self-taught developer named Florent (🇫🇷️), and I really enjoy working on open source software. Here's some of the stuff I made:

 * [DevLint](https://github.com/cheap-glitch/devlint) – A meta-linter for config files and project structures (_WIP_)
 * [Warpgate](https://github.com/cheap-glitch/warpgate) – A tiny browser extension to access any of your starred GitHub repos directly from the address bar
 * [vim.help](https://github.com/cheap-glitch/vim.help) – A web version of Vim's help manual (_WIP_)
 * [Fretboarder](https://fretboarder.app) – A web app to visualize scales and arpeggios on various fretboards
 * [and more!](https://github.com/cheap-glitch?tab=repositories&sort=stargazers)

I'm also a maintainer of the awesome [:octocat: Refined GitHub](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github) extension — if you don't already use it, you should start right now! It will make your day-to-day usage of GitHub a lot more productive and enjoyable.

Your sponsorship will allow me to spend more time on OSS, and hopefully make more of my ideas a reality ❤️
